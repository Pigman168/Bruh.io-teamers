# Bruh.io Teamers/Cheaters

"No asking to team with other players. No Teaming."

Users from this list don't understand this rule.
Shame on you!

If you want to be removed from this list, you must start to follow the rules of the game and buy a skin to support game developers.

[List of teamers/cheaters](user-list)

Everyone can add cheaters/teamres to the list. Don't put people in there if they dont know teaming isn't allowed put them in there if you tell them that and they tell you to piss off.

Make some screenshot or video from game/chat and share it with me or on official [Bruh.io Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/bitfoxgames).
